### Orphaned Quora links. 

Quora has some feeds and pages that aren't accessible from the user interface.
Some of them are included below.

*   [Directory - Quora](http://www.quora.com/directory/)

    Quora has a directory of every user, topic, question and blog on the site.
    This is never shown as a link on the site anywhere, but for automated
    processes it can be quite useful. It appears to be used for SEO purposes,
    but itâ€™s not updated anymore.
    
*   [Reviews Feed - Quora](http://www.quora.com/reviews)

    The latest redesign to the feed removes the link to the Reviews feed. Here
    it is.
    
*   [Quora Shuffle](http://www.quora.com/shuffle)
    
    Quora's little known Shuffle feature lets you browse random content. 

*   [Open Questions](https://www.quora.com/Quora/open_questions)

    Get a list of unanswered questions in a topic by appending
    `/open_questions` to its URL.

*   [RSS feed of an user](https://www.quora.com/Thomas-Foster/rss)

    Quora support RSS feeds on users, topics, blogs and main page. Append
    `/rss` to an URL to get the RSS feed.
