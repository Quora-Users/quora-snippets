Here are various code snippets I’ve used to [answer questions][questions] on
Quora. They have to be run in the browser console on the website (and sometimes
on specific pages). They are mostly throwaway code, but I post them here, it can
be useful for others and to update my answers.

Some snippets may be outdated as Quora’s HTML sometimes changes.
